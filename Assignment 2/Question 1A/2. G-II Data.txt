To set the proper sample for panel data analysis, use observations for which SMALL = 0.  To obtain the balanced panel, then use only observations with GROUPTI = 5.
The variables in the file are
COMP = composite measure of health care attainment;
LCOMP = logCOMP
POPDEN = population density*
PUBTHE = proportion of health expenditure paid by bublic authorities
GDPC = normalized per capita GDP; LGDPC = logGDPC; LGDPC2 = log-squaredGDPC
YEAR = 1993,...,1997;  TIME = 1,2,3,4,5;  T93, T94, T95, T96, T97 = year dummy variables
HEXP = per capita health expenditure; 
LHEXP = logHEXP; 
LHEXP2 = log-squaredHEXP
HC3 = educational attainment; 
LHC = logHC3; 
LHC2 = log-squaredHC3; 
LHEXPHC = logHEXP * logHC3
OECD = dummy variable for OECD country (30 countries)
GINI = gini coefficient for income inequality
GEFF = world bank measure of government effectiveness*
VOICE = world bank measure of democratization of the political process*

SMALL = indicator for states, provinces, etc. SMALL > 0 implies internal political unit, = 0 implies country observation
COUNTRY = number assigned to country
STRATUM = another country indicator
GROUPTI = number of observations when SMALL = 0. Usually 5, some = 1, one country = 4.
TROPICS = dummy variable for tropical location
DALE = Disability adjusted life expectancy (other measure);
LDALE = logDALE

Dep: GDPC / COMP / LHEXP, 
Indeps: COMP, DALE, HEXP, HC3, Dummies
